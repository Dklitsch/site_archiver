A tool for site admins to make copies of their website when they don't have access to their source code.

Aimed at a non-technical audience the tool has a graphical interface and requires no installation other than the main project.

I was inspired by the plight of old wikis running on proprietary software. These sites may have large communities but no access to their files in case their host goes down.
